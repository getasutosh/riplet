1. Project Overview
	As part of our expanding offerings, we have a wide array of products, with more in development. It can be overwhelming for users to keep track of all the features and capabilities. What if we introduced an AI assistant that not only guides users on how to perform tasks but, in some cases, does it for them?
	Objective: Develop an AI assistant integrated into Rippling’s portal to assist users by providing step-by-step instructions and performing actions across all Rippling products.
	Goal: Enhance user experience by simplifying interactions with Rippling’s platform, reducing user frustration, and improving efficiency.

2. Core Features for MVP
	Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine:

	Capability: Interpret user queries accurately, recognizing various phrasings and intents.
	Scope: Basic understanding of common user requests and actions within Rippling products.
	Contextual Awareness:

	Capability: Identify which product or feature the user is interacting with and provide relevant assistance.
	Scope: Contextual help for at least three core products (e.g., HR management, payroll, benefits).
	Step-by-Step Guidance:

	Capability: Provide users with detailed instructions to complete tasks within Rippling products.
	Scope: Cover the most common 10-15 user queries/actions within the selected core products.
	Action Execution:

	Capability: Perform certain user-authorized actions directly within the platform.
	Scope: Limited to simple, non-critical actions such as updating user profile information or generating standard reports.
	Multi-Platform Accessibility:

	Capability: Ensure the assistant is accessible on the web version of Rippling.
	Scope: Web integration only; mobile and other platforms will be considered in later phases.
	User Feedback Mechanism:

	Capability: Allow users to provide feedback on the assistant’s performance.
	Scope: Simple thumbs up/down or star rating system.
3. Technical Architecture
	Backend:

	NLP Engine: Integrate a third-party NLP service (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT, Google Dialogflow) or develop a custom solution.
	Database: Store user interactions, contextual data, and feedback.
	API Layer: Interface with Rippling’s existing backend to execute actions and fetch data.
	Frontend:

	User Interface: Develop a user-friendly chat interface integrated into Rippling’s portal.
	Accessibility: Ensure the assistant is easy to invoke and use, with clear instructions for users.
	Security:

	Data Privacy: Ensure that user data is securely handled, complying with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
	Access Control: Implement role-based permissions for action execution.
4. Success Metrics
	User Engagement: Measure the number of interactions with the AI assistant.
	Task Completion Rate: Track the percentage of successfully completed tasks with the assistant’s help.
	User Satisfaction: Collect feedback and analyze user satisfaction ratings.
	Response Accuracy: Monitor the accuracy of the assistant’s responses and actions.
